With no right angles in its base, the CAELUM table lamp is a dynamic celebration of engineering. Its main feature is the hanging cylindrical bezel – in defiance of convention it used on its own rather than being covered by a light-emitting lampshade. This bezel is uniformly lit from within, which makes it not only a light- source but also a focal point for the space.
