The PICTOR I armchair has been considered from every angle so that it can grace any open space. The unusual combination of soft fabrics and surface textures achieves an intriguing trompe l'œil effect, while the perfect intersection of these elements at the ‘cut’ line is a tribute to the cabinetmaker's mastery.
