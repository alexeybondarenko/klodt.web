The PRAECIPUA night table draws its inspiration from the design of the magazine table of the same name. With support provided by crafted metal elements, the tabletop is inlaid with veneers of a variety of precious woods. The mix of grey hues and rich grain along with the simple construction mean that this piece will complement any kind of interior scheme.
